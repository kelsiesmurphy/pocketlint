<!-- BUILT WITH -->
## Built With

* React
* MongoDB
* Express.js
* NodeJS
* TailwindCSS

<!-- REFLECTIONS -->
## Reflections
In using TailwindCSS for the first time, I have discovered its pros and cons, and have come to the conclusion that I would use it again for personal projects in the future. I also have increased my knowledge in MongoDB and Express, and the Stripe API has very thorough documentation. This was a fun project to do, and the next step would probably be to build out an admin dashboard.
